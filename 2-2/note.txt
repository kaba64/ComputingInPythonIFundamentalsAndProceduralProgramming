int(variable): Takes as input some variable (usually a string) and attempts to convert it to an integer, returning the integer if successful or raising a ValueError if unsuccessful. This function will work if variable is a string made up only of digits and, optionally, the negative sign.

bool(variable): Takes as input some variable (usually a string) and attempts to convert it to a boolean, returning the boolean value if successful or raising a ValueError if unsuccessful. Generally, this function returns False if variable is 0 or an empty string, True if variable is anything else.

float(variable): Takes as input some variable (usually a string) and attempts to convert it to a float, returning the float if successful or raising a ValueError if unsuccessful. This function will work if variable is a string made up only of digits and, optionally, a negative sign and a decimal point.
